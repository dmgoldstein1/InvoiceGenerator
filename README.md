## YAML Data Format

The system expects a YAML file with the following structure:

  invoice_date: '8/14/2024'
  from_contact:
    name: 'Your Name'
    title: 'Your Title'
    address: 'Your Address'
    phone: 'Your Phone'
    email: 'your@email.com'
  to_contact:
    name: 'Client Name'
    company: 'Client Company' # Optional
    address: 'Client Address'
    phone: 'Client Phone'
    email: 'client@email.com'
  cc_contacts: # Optional
    - name: 'CC Name'
      email: 'cc@email.com'

cover_letter:
  greeting: 'Hello Dr. Client,'
  body: |
    Your cover letter text here.
    
    Multiple paragraphs are supported.
  closing: 'Sincerely,'
  signature: 'Your Name'

invoice_items:
  # Time-based billing
  - date: 4/11/2024
    description: 'Project Description'

  # Fixed amount billing
  - date: 4/11/2024
    description: 'Fixed Service'
    amount: 625.00
```

## Color Scheme

The application uses a professional color palette:
- **Primary Blue**: #2c5aa0 (headers, emphasis)
- **Secondary Gray**: #666666 (labels, secondary text)
- **Text**: #333333 (main content)
- **Light Background**: #f8f9fa (alternating rows)
- **Borders**: #dee2e6 (subtle separators)

## Logging

Comprehensive logging is saved to `logs/invoice-generator-log-{timestamp}.log` with:

├── index.js                  # HTML-based version (Puppeteer)
├── index-pdfkit.js          # Direct PDF version (PDFKit V1)

└── logs/                    # Application logs
```

## Dependencies

- **js-yaml**: YAML parsing
- **pdfkit**: Direct PDF generation
- **moment**: Date formatting (legacy support)
- **handlebars**: Template processing (HTML version)
- **puppeteer**: Browser-based PDF generation (HTML version)

## Performance

- Average generation time: ~180ms per document set
- Memory efficient with streaming PDF generation
- Handles complex invoices with multiple line items

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install`
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure write access to `output/` and `logs/` directories
3. **YAML errors**: Validate your YAML syntax
4. **PDF issues**: Check disk space and file permissions

## Development

The system includes three implementations:
1. **generator.js** (Recommended): Enhanced PDFKit-based generator with professional styling
2. **index-pdfkit.js**: Basic PDFKit implementation
3. **index.js**: HTML-to-PDF using Puppeteer (requires browser)

Use `generator.js` for production use as it provides the best balance of features, performance, and reliability.
