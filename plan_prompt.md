I created this invoice and cover letter template in macOS Pages. I did not start with a template, but rather I made it myself. I like the visual design style it uses, but I spent a lot of time manually inputting data, making sure that the alternating row background color is consistent, doing basic multiplication of hours worked times hourly rate, etc.

I'd like you to study "Invoice 23 for SAV-for-template.pdf", learn it's design language, including fonts, colors, indentations, use of bold, italics, font size, how dates, times, addresses are stylized etc. Make note of how line breaks within each cells of the invoice are used only as needed, never in the middle of the word, and at a gramatically sensible point in the phrase whenever possible. The columns are optimized for good line breaking as much as possible.

Once you study this PDF as a guide, I want you to create a node.JS project that I can input a YAML file into with all information in the both the cover letter and the invoice, and it will output a PDF that follows all the visual design rules in the sample PDF. Create test data, and iterate your code against that test data to see how it performs. Save each test PDF and each test YAML data file. Learn from each test, iterate, debug, improve and test again until you are satisfied that any cover letter and invoice data fed into the engine will produce a PDF file that complies with the style of the template.
