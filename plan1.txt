I created this invoice and cover letter template in macOS Pages. I did not start with a template, but rather I made it myself. I like the visual design style it uses, but I spent a lot of time manually inputting data, making sure that the alternating row background color is consistent, doing basic multiplication of hours worked times hourly rate, etc.

I'd like you to study "Invoice 21 for SAV-for-template.pdf" and "Invoice 23 for SAV-for-template.pdf". Learn the design language, including fonts, colors, indentations, use of bold, italics, font size, how dates, times, addresses are stylized etc. Make note of how line breaks within each cells of the invoice are used only as needed, never in the middle of the word, and at a gramatically sensible point in the phrase whenever possible. The columns are optimized for good line breaking as much as possible.

Also study "cover_letter_and_invoice_example.yaml". You'll see that the YAML file contains the data that was formatted and designed to make the PDFs. The YAML is the raw information, and the PDFs are the manually formatted final product.

Your task it to create a node.JS project that I can input a YAML file into with all information in the both the cover letter and the invoice, and it will output a PDF that follows all the visual design rules in the sample PDF. Use the provided data to test your code, fix bugs and iterate to see how it performs. Save each test PDF file. Learn from each test, iterate, debug, improve and test again until you are satisfied that any cover letter and invoice data fed into the engine will produce a PDF file that complies with the style of the template.
