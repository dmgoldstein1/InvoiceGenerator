# Invoice PDF Generator

## Overview

The Invoice PDF Generator is a Node.js application designed to create PDF invoices and cover letters based on input data provided in a YAML file. The generated PDFs adhere to specific design specifications, ensuring a professional and consistent appearance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
invoice-pdf-generator
├── src
│   ├── index.js               # Entry point for the application
│   ├── pdfGenerator.js        # Logic for generating PDF documents
│   ├── yamlParser.js          # Parses the input YAML file
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── invoiceStyles.js    # Styling rules for the invoice PDF
│   └── templates
│       ├── coverLetterTemplate.js # Template structure for the cover letter
│       └── invoiceTemplate.js      # Template structure for the invoice
├── test
│   ├── testData.yaml          # Sample data for testing
│   ├── testInvoice.pdf        # Sample output PDF for the invoice
│   ├── testCoverLetter.pdf    # Sample output PDF for the cover letter
│   └── test.js                # Test cases for validating functionality
├── package.json               # npm configuration file
├── .gitignore                 # Files and directories to ignore by Git
└── README.md                  # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd invoice-pdf-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Prepare your YAML file:**
   Create a YAML file with the necessary data for the invoice and cover letter.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   node src/index.js <path-to-your-yaml-file>
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Ensure that your YAML file is structured correctly to match the expected input format.
- The generated PDFs will be saved in the output directory specified in the code.

## Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```
npm test
```

This will validate the functionality of the PDF generation process against the sample data provided in `test/testData.yaml`.
